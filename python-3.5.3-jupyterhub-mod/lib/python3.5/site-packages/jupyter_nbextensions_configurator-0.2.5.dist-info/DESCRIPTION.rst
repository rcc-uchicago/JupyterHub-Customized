The jupyter_nbextensions_configurator jupyter server extension provides
graphical user interfaces for configuring which nbextensions are enabled (load
automatically for every notebook), and display their readme files.
In addition, for nbextensions which include an appropriate yaml descriptor
file, the interface also provides controls to configure the nbextensions'
options.
